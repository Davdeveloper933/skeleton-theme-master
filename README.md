#Testing task Shopify
1. Create a test store
Install the theme in a store (just an empty skeleton of the theme, and work in it)
Deploy the project locally using the Theme Kit
Create several products for development and testing (you can import this CSV file)
Make header and product section (layout):
all components are custom (you can follow the example of other themes, but not copy-paste)
you need to use liquid, language variables, and a theme customizer to fill the content (there should be no static, everything changes dynamically either through the customizer or through the product admin panel)
the ability to customize the navigation header through the navigation section in the admin panel
adaptability (mobile, tablet, desktop)
technologies: theme kit, BEM, scss, webpack or gulp
commit everything in git, each ready-made functionality is a separate commit, upload the result to your Github
Make an ajax cart (without using apps) (layout, example)
the ability to change the quantity and remove items from a basket
Provide a link to GitHub, a link to the store with access to the admin panel
