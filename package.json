Create several products for development and testing (you can import this CSV file) +\r 5. Make header and product section (layout):\r - all components are custom (you can follow the example of other themes, but not copy-paste)\r - you need to use liquid, language variables, and a theme customizer to fill the content (there should be no static, everything changes dynamically either through the customizer or through the product admin panel)\r - the ability to customize the navigation header through the navigation section in the admin panel\r - adaptability (mobile, tablet, desktop)\r - technologies: theme kit, BEM, scss, webpack or gulp\r - commit everything in git, each ready-made functionality is a separate commit, upload the result to your Github\r 6. Make an ajax cart (without using apps) (layout, example)\r - the ability to change the quantity and remove items from a basket\r 7.
